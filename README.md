Malibu
=========

This project is **not yet ready for use** - stay tuned.

Goal
----------------

A nightly (?) build process that will use Streisand to provision a set of cloud
servers (Digital Ocean, AWS, etc) and a set of client machines. Client machines
will perform end-to-end tests of the Streisand services (Shadowsocks, SSH
forwading, OpenVPN, etc). A machine-consumable report (JSON? YAML?) is generated
with success/failure for different services arranged by cloud provider.

Other projects have test farms, Streisand has a Malibu test mansion. We're fancy
like that.
